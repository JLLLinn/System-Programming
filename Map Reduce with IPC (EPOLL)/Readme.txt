This program is one of my system programming course assignments. It does map reduce with IPC (EPOLL, specifically)

In 2004, Google developed a general framework for processing large data sets on clusters of computers. This is a very small version of it J, it ultimately reduce the ¡°Alice In Wonderland¡± to the longest word in the whole book.

To compile, run the following commands from a command prompt on a Linux machine:
%> make clean 
%> make

To run the test:
%> ./test#	Here # is the number of test

For example:
%> ./test6

Test 6 generates the longest word in Alice in wonderland. It is really long..
