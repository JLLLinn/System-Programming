This program is my implementation of mergesort using threads
Interesting and Fun!

To compile: "make clean" --> "make"

Specify a specific random sequence by supplying a seed, and export it to a file 
eg: "./gen --min 0 --max 50 --seed 0 25 >example1.txt"

To run with initially 5 segments:
"./msort 5 <example1.txt"
